# ðŸš€ Startup Pitch Deck Analyzer

An AI-powered tool that analyzes startup pitch deck PDFs and provides detailed evaluations using OpenAI's GPT-4.

## Features

- **PDF Text Extraction**: Automatically extracts text from uploaded pitch deck PDFs
- **AI-Powered Analysis**: Uses GPT-4 to evaluate startups based on key criteria
- **Team Information Extraction**: Identifies team members, contacts, and qualifications
- **Market Analysis**: Evaluates problem-solution fit, market size, and competitive advantages
- **Traction Assessment**: Analyzes evidence of product-market fit and growth
- **Debug Mode**: Provides detailed error information for troubleshooting

## Analysis Framework

The tool evaluates pitch decks based on five critical questions:

1. **Problem**: What painful problem is this solving, and for whom?
2. **Solution**: Why is this solution uniquely better than existing alternatives?
3. **Market**: How big is the market opportunity, and how fast is it growing?
4. **Traction**: What evidence is there that this works (users, pilots, revenue)?
5. **Team**: Why is this team the right one to win?
